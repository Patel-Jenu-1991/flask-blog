# Flask Blog App

Requirements:

1. After a user logs in they are presented
with all of the blog posts.

2. Users can add new, text-only blog entries
from the same screen, read the entries themselves,
or log out.

That's it.

Files and Directories:

1. blog.py - all of the logic (Python/Flask code)
goes into this file.

2. static - this directory holds static files
(anything that is not dynamic) like JavaScript
files, CSS stylesheets, and images.

3. templates - houses all the HTML files.
